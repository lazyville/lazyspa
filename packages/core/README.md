Utilities for building games and managing turn-based interactions.

## Development

Install dependencies (if any) and run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This compiles the TypeScript sources and executes the example tests.

To compile without running tests:

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiled artifacts will be written to the `dist/` directory.
