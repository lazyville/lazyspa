## Chrono Courier — time-bending delivery roguelite (added 2025-09-02)

**Elevator pitch:** A top-down roguelite where you’re a courier who can rewind the last 5 seconds. Race across a clockwork city to deliver fragile packages while chaining near-misses, time-rewinds, and traversal gadgets. The city “remembers” your routes and adapts.

**Core loop:**
1) Pick a delivery job with risk/reward modifiers.  
2) Dash through traffic/patrols, using a 5-sec rewind to undo mistakes or optimize routes.  
3) Deliver on time to bank tips → buy route intel, gadgets, or rewind upgrades.  
4) City districts unlock; heat and hazards escalate run-to-run.

**Key mechanics:**
- **Micro-rewind (5s buffer):** Restores position, stamina, gadget cooldowns; world state partially persists (e.g., moved obstacles stay moved).  
- **Momentum & threading:** Close calls build a “Thread” meter that boosts speed and slows time briefly when full.  
- **Dynamic routes:** Roadworks, protests, and patrol shifts randomize chokepoints; intel reveals upcoming blockers.  
- **Gadgets:** Grapple spool, dash skates, decoy drone, collapsible ramp, package stabilizer.  
- **Package traits:** Fragile, leaky, heavy, magnetized (affects physics and gadget synergy).

**Progression & meta:**
- Unlock courier licenses (perks), district shortcuts, and gadget variants.  
- Permanent upgrades focus on **information** (better forecasts/route intel) rather than raw speed to preserve challenge.

**Run structure:** 15–25 minute runs; 3–5 deliveries per district; boss-style “mega-delivery” that tests route planning under shifting hazards.

**Art & audio direction:** Clean isometric look; bold color blocks for telegraphing hazards; rhythmic synth score that layers with Thread meter.

**Scope notes (MVP):**
- 2 districts, 6 gadgets, 8 hazard types, 12 package traits, 1 mega-delivery.  
- No combat; fail state is package damage/timeouts.  
- Seeded daily challenge and weekly route gauntlet.

**Stretch ideas:** Co-op relay deliveries; photo mode “route ghost”; creator mode for custom route puzzles.

**Inspirations:** SPEED runners, Katana ZERO rewinds (feel), Into the Breach planning clarity.
